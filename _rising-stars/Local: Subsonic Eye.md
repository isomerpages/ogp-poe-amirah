<p>Home-grown indie band Subsonic Eye is embarking on their first US tour,
with eight shows scheduled across major cities in June. The quintet, known
for their dream pop and shoegaze sound, comprises singer Nur Wahidah, guitarists
Daniel Borces and Jared Lim, bassist Spencer Tan, and drummer Lucas Tee,
all in their early 20s.</p>
<p>Their tour kicks off in Los Angeles on June 11 and concludes in Boston
on June 21, with performances also slated for cities like Portland, Seattle,
and New York. Believed to be the first local band to tour overseas since
the pandemic, Subsonic Eye aims to put Singapore on the indie rock map.</p>
<p>Having previously performed for Seattle radio station KEXP FM's online
music series, the band chose to tour the US to further their exposure and
experience the music scene firsthand. Despite pandemic challenges, they
opted for a June tour to coincide with members' school holidays and work
commitments.</p>
<p>Funding for the tour comes from a National Arts Council grant, accumulated
funds from past performances and merchandise sales, as well as personal
contributions from each member. Subsonic Eye, formed in 2016, has participated
in mentorship programs like NAC's Noise Music Mentorship and Esplanade's
Baybeats Budding Bands, releasing successful albums like "Strawberry Feels"
and "Nature Of Things", which earned acclaim from NME and Bandcamp.</p>
