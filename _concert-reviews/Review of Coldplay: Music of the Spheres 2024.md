<p>Like over 330k others, I was among those who attended one of the most
anticipated concerts in Singapore, Coldplay's Music of the Spheres.</p>
<p>The concert started off with local singer Rriley and special appearance
by her former band members, Narelle, Benjamin and Jonathan from The Sam
Willows. As someone who followed the band's journey from the start to their
indefinite hiatus, it was surely nostalgic seeing the four back together
on stage.</p>

<p>Whilst waiting for Chris Martin and the band to come on stage, a broadcast
highlighted Coldplay's initiatives to go green. Learning about the band's
efforts to be more environmentally friendly was insightful, and served
as a good reminder to practice good habits.</p>

<p>The actual concert started shortly after and we were embraced by Coldplay's
energetic presence and mesmerising visuals. It's no secret that Chris Martin's
vocals blew us all away, but so did the colourful and interactive set.
The crowd was greeted with confetti and bouncy balls, and the RFID wristbands
lit up the stadium in colours only capturable in real-time.</p>
<p>Not only were screams and "lit" vibes shared that night, tears were shed
as well. On the fourth night - the night I attended, Chris dedicated Everglow
to fans who have lost someone important in their lives. It was truly a
heartwarming and emotional section of the concert that will be remembered
by fans for a lifetime.Hellooooooooo</p>

<p>After a few more songs, the band ended the night with Fix You and guided
us back to our homes. Thanks to the ushering and MRT team, our journey
back home was quick and no hiccups were experienced.</p>
<p>This was my first big concert after lifting of Covid-19 restrictions,
and I'm pleased to say that I had a wonderful time and I'm definitely looking
forward to attend more concerts in the near future.</p>
