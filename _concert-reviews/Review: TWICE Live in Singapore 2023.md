<p>A TWICE concert is an unparalleled experience. The eight-year journey
of this nine-member K-pop girl group has honed their ability to captivate
their audience, delivering a show that thrills from start to finish. Despite
a slight delay, the anticipation among Singapore's ONCEs only heightened
as TWICE took the stage with the electrifying 'Set Me Free,' followed by
the explosive 'I Can't Stop Me' from 2020.</p>
<p>Over the course of three hours, TWICE showcased their individual talents
through solo performances, revealing a depth of artistry beyond their collective
allure. From Chaeyoung's original song 'My Guitar' to Jeongyeon's infectious
cover of Justin Timberlake's 'Can't Stop the Feeling,' each member left
an indelible mark on the audience.</p>
<p>Momo dazzled with her dynamic dance cover of Beyonc√©'s 'Move' and a jaw-dropping
pole dancing routine, while Dahyun's emotional rendition of Colbie Caillat's
'Try' and Mina's daring cover of Ariana Grande's '7 Rings' showcased their
versatility. However, it was Jihyo who stole the spotlight with the debut
live performance of her solo single, 'Killin' Me Good,' and her unwavering
presence throughout the night.</p>

<p>Beyond the performances, TWICE's 'Ready to Be' concert underscored the
power of K-pop fandoms to foster a sense of community, evident in moments
like the collective shout of "JYP" during 'Alcohol-free' and fans dancing
along to every song.</p>
<p>While the encore may have had a slight misstep with the selection of 'Shot
Clock,' TWICE's triumphant return to Singapore after four years was undeniable.
They left an indelible mark on the hearts of ONCEs, demonstrating why they
remain one of K-pop's most beloved acts. Here's to hoping their next visit
won't keep fans waiting as long.</p>
